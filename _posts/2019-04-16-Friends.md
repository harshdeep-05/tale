This poem is a farewell to my friends, with key memories subtly woven in, reflecting some of our best moments together. As the title suggests, this part will only make sense to those who were there to experience it.

Life's good, what's required,<br/>
is monobasic acid HA, that can<br/>
neutralise all your basic problems<br/>
& bring a wide smile on your face.<br/>
<br/>
Or may be a simple smile<br/>
we all will have, and<br/>
agree upon, that our destiny<br/>
is not in the hands of any<br/>
Chand Tare Rashi, but<br/>
it is us & our attitude that<br/>
will carry us, to the <br/>
future we want to be in<br/>
& be the man whom everyone grace.<br/>
<br/>
What makes me different, is the<br/>
VG spectacles that I do not possess,<br/>
may be inevitable, may be not.<br/>
but our friendship is eternal.<br/>
Some may fall, but not us.<br/>
You might not understand few of above.<br/>
After all, it's me Harshdeep :)<br/>
and I Love You 3000.<br/>
