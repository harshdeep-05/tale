Life's good, what's required,
is monobasic acid HA, that can
neutralise all your basic problems
& birng a wide smile on your face.

Or may be a simple smile
we all will have, and
agree upon, that our destiny
is not in the hands of any
Chand Tare Rashi, but
it is us & our attitude that
will carry us, to the 
future we want to be in
& be the man whom everyone grace.

What makes me different, is the
VG spectacles that I do not posses,
may be inevitbale, may be not.
but our friendship is eternal.
Some may fall, but not us.
You might not understand few of above.
After all, it's me Harshdeep :)
and I Love You 3000.
