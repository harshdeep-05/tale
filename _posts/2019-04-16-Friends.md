Life's good, what's required,<br/>
is monobasic acid HA, that can<br/>
neutralise all your basic problems<br/>
& birng a wide smile on your face.<br/>
<br/>
Or may be a simple smile<br/>
we all will have, and<br/>
agree upon, that our destiny<br/>
is not in the hands of any<br/>
Chand Tare Rashi, but<br/>
it is us & our attitude that<br/>
will carry us, to the <br/>
future we want to be in<br/>
& be the man whom everyone grace.<br/>
<br/>
What makes me different, is the<br/>
VG spectacles that I do not posses,<br/>
may be inevitbale, may be not.<br/>
but our friendship is eternal.<br/>
Some may fall, but not us.<br/>
You might not understand few of above.<br/>
After all, it's me Harshdeep :)<br/>
and I Love You 3000.<br/>
