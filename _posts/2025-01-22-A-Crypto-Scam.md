_Making money out of thin air_
<!--more-->

I have a piece of blank paper. I want to generate millions of dollars from this blank paper. Is it possible? and How?
So what if, I say to everyone, "Hey, I have got this special piece of paper and there are only thousands of it." I list the paper at a famous exchange, and hire two guys(lets call them A and B), and hand them 50 pieces each and give them 50 dollars. 

A says to B I want to buy 1 paper from B at 1 dollar.
A has 51 (and 49 dollar) and B has 49 paper (and 51 dollar). The value of my paper is set at 1 dollar now. 
B buys the paper back from A at 1 dollar. Now we are back to 50-50.

A goes now, "Hey B,wanna sell me your paper at 2 dollar?"
And this goes on and my paper values at 100 dollars now. Other traders see the hype of this new paper and want some piece of it too. 
And this is how my friends, I am the 5th richest person right now.
