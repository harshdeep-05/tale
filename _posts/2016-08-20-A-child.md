>A first read of this poem
>gives a view of a sick child who is in his last days of suffering, but what it really about is
>a young kid who is in depression, with dying hope of living and enjoying life. 
>With few people understanding his suffering, some making fun, few who cares, 
>his life will take him only into darkness from this point.

I am a strong boy<br/>
that's what mama says<br/>
but i dont feel so<br/>
lying on bed for days<br/>
<br/>
my day starts<br/>
up with a hare heart<br/>
and ends<br/>
as the whole world had blends<br/>
<br/>
Everyone tries <br/>
to relish my sighs<br/>
but i am the one <br/>
who lives like the tasteless bunn<br/>
<br/>
I made them cry<br/>
when i closed my eyes<br/>
my world had taken its new flight<br/>
and i could see no light<br/>
