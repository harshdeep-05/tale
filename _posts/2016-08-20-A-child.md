A Child!<br/>
I am a strong boy<br/>
that's what mama says<br/>
but i dont feel so<br/>
lying on bed for days<br/>
<br/>
my day starts<br/>
up with a hare heart<br/>
and ends<br/>
as the whole world had blends<br/>
<br/>
Everyone tries <br/>
to relish my sighs<br/>
but i am the one <br/>
who lives like the tasteless bunn<br/>
<br/>
I made mumma cry<br/>
when i closed my eyes<br/>
my world had taken its new flight<br/>
and i could see no light<br/>
