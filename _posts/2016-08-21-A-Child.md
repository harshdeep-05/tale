A Child!
I am a strong boy
that's what mama says
but i dont feel so
lying on bed for days



my day starts
up with a hare heart
and ends
as the whole world had blends



Everyone tries 
to relish my sighs
but i am the one 
who lives like the tasteless bunn




I made mumma cry
when i closed my eyes
my world had taken its new flight
and i could see no light
