I am Harshdeep! Currently @IIT Guwahati. I am an aspiring Software Developer, a talented Guitarist and an able dancer. I used to have a great passion for penning my thoughts down, and this website is just an attempt to live and feel that passion again. You will find here, some of poems I had written, books review I have read and whatever I can update.

Thanks for reading!
